= SemanticNaming

Semantic URL handling that can be used with the Talia system or ActiveRDF. This contains
a number of methods of encoding semantic URIs, dealing with namespaces and providing a 
neat interface to access URIs.

The library offers additional functionality when active_rdf is installed. Note that at this
point in time you should use the 'activerdf_net7' gem, as it's tuned to work with the 
semantic naming. The default activerdf gem *will* cause problems.
